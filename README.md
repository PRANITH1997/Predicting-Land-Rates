## Overview

Predicting land rates is crucial for various industries, including real estate and urban planning. This project demonstrates how to leverage Python libraries for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning to build a predictive model for land rates.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: A versatile data manipulation library for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data.
- **Matplotlib**: A powerful visualization library for creating static, interactive, and dynamic visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: A high-level interface to Matplotlib for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.
- **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library for predictive data analysis, including model building and evaluation.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains land-related features, including location, size, nearby amenities, and historical land rates. The data is available in a CSV format and can be accessed in the `data` directory.

## Installation
